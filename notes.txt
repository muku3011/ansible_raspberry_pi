Issue:
	It is recommended that your private key files are NOT accessible by others.
	This private key will be ignored.	
Solution:
	The keys need to be read-writable only by you:
	> chmod 600 ~/.ssh/ansible
	Alternatively, the keys can be only readable by you (this also blocks your write access):
	> chmod 400 ~/.ssh/ansible

Ansible inventory list all hosts and information:
	> ansible-inventory -i inventory.yml --list

Ansible inventory ping host:
	> ansible <hostname> -m ping -i inventory.yml
